# Alex-Search-Rescue-Robot

## Introduction

Our project aims to build a tele-operated robot, Alex, which can be used to perform search and rescue operations effectively. In order to achieve this purpose, Alex comes with a variety of specifications and requirements that will be further explored in this report. In order to demonstrate Alexâ€™s capabilities, Alex is placed in a 3 m^2 maze filled with obstacles that simulates a disaster area. These obstacles are designed to be at least 18 cm in height which is also the typical Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) mounting height. In addition, the maze contains 2 - 4 rooms of which Alex needs to map out.

Alex is expected to move according to the commands (forward, backward, left or right), map out the maze and identify objects during the course of the simulation. There will be 2 - 3 red or green regularly shaped coloured objects (e.g. cube, cylinder) that will be scattered throughout the rooms. Upon locating an object, Alex will have to determine the colour of the object and report the information to the operator.

The project objectives are met when Alex has successfully performed the above mentioned tasks without faults and collisions.
