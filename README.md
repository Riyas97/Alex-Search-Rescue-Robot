# Alex-Search-Rescue-Robot

## Introduction

Our project aims to build a tele-operated robot, Alex, which can be used to perform search and rescue operations effectively. In order to achieve this purpose, Alex comes with a variety of specifications and requirements that will be further explored in the final report document. 

## Features of Alex
- Move according to the commands (forward, backward, left or right)
- Ability to detect walls and avoid them
- Ability to map out the maze and identify objects during the course of the simulation
- Ability to detect colour of regularly shaped coloured objects (e.g. cube, cylinder) and report the information to the operator
- Ability to detect frequency of sound waves and change direction with respect to the frequency
- Play celebratory tune upon finishing a maze
